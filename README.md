# Project-6
 News App

The goal was to create a News feed app which provides regularly-updated news using Guardian News API related to a particular topic, person, or location. Clicking on each news item on the list opens that news in a web browser.

Used asynctask in HTTP networking, JSON parsing, and threads. Implemented a Preference Fragment and Preference summary. Launched a Settings Activity from a menu in the Main Activity and built Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to URL.
